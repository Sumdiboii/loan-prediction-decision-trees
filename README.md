## 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer, based on a dataset of 5,000 banking records. Key features include customer income, education level, credit card spending, mortgage value, and account behavior. The model was trained using scikit-learn and evaluated with a classification report and confusion matrix, achieving an **accuracy of 97%**, with **92% precision** and **76% recall** for predicting positive loan responses.
